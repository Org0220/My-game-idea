# My-game-idea
Here i will write all ideas that comes in my mind

Game idea: I think to make a platformer game about two characters who are in love and want to meet each other as soon as possible. But to achieve their goal, they need to pass some challenges. 

Scenario and characters description: So there will be a boy and a girl class. They will be the main characters. There will be some or one class(es) for the platformes that they will use to move in the map. And obviously there will be a world class as well. For the design I don't really have some ideas about it.

Charactersâ€™ actions and goals: They need to touch each other by passing the chalanges.

Progression of levels: After they meet each other, another level starts where they are seperated and need to pass the chalanges to meet each other.

Sources of inspiration: There was a free online game called "Fire boy and Water Girl" It was basically a platform game where they needed to pass the chalanges behind them to arive to the end. To complete the challanges they needed to help each other all along the game play.

What skills/interests you are looking for in team mate: Preferable good skills in geometry and calculations because I think that will be the most painful part of the creation of the code.
